Chapter 1: Integrated Enablers, Frameworks, and Practices In the fast-paced commercial environment where business ambitions seek to adopt emerging technologies to support digital strategy while at the same time focusing on running stable operations, IT service organizations find themselves at a crossroads. To thrive, they're compelled to embrace a value centric, high-speed approach to managing IT services, an approach that demands accelerated value delivery while simultaneously elevating service quality, fostering innovation, and cultivating agility. Amidst the ever-shifting landscape of disruptive technologies and the relentless tide of societal and business changes, IT organizations grapple with an imposing challenge. They recognize the imperative of swift action, striving to hasten the delivery of value while forging stronger connections and collaboration across their internal teams and external service partners. This demands not just speed but collaboration and alignment among people, teams, and the broader network of external service In the quest to navigate these complex and almost paradoxical business goals, many IT service provider organizations have turned to a variety of sources for published IT management practices and models. The good news is that there is no shortage of IT governance, management, and process frameworks, such as COBIT, ITIL, PMBOK, SAFe, and many others which provide valuable guidance and best practices for managing IT services and projects. They offer a structured approach to defining, documenting, and automating processes, aiming to increase efficiency and reduce risks. However, these frameworks alone fall short of addressing the complex challenges faced by IT organizations in today's fast-paced digital Recognizing this limitation, forward-thinking service organizations understand that the path to long term success lies in more than just process optimization and integration. While processes play a crucial role, they are only a piece of the larger picture of an integrated IT business management approach. To achieve their goals effectively, IT organizations must leverage enabling methodologies that are focused on business agility, managing organizational change, improved efficiency, and automation while at the same time reducing costs. Technology leadership understands that there are various enablers, frameworks, and models that are critical to the long-term success of these goals. The ability to leverage and integrate practices such as Lean, Agile, DevOps, key enabler roles, and organizational change providers. world. management to name a few.

Chapter 1: Integrated Enablers, Frameworks, and Practices 10 This book focuses on understanding how enablers such as the ones listed here but not limited to support the goals of an integrated IT business management approach: Lean: Thinking has significantly influenced all modern IT management frameworks, making it a crucial factor in enabling integrated IT business management. Originally derived from the manufacturing industry, these principles prioritize waste elimination, continuous process improvement, and focus on value creation. Through the implementation of Lean practices and value stream mapping, IT service organizations can streamline their operations, minimize Agile: Agile Scrum is another methodology that has gained significant traction in recent years. Agile principles prioritize iterative development, cross-functional collaboration, and rapid response to change. By adopting Agile practices, IT organizations can embrace flexibility and adaptability, empowering teams to deliver value incrementally and respond swiftly to evolving DevOps: Describes a grassroots movement and set of practices that emphasize the integration of development and operations teams, enabling organizations to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery. By fostering a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous integration and deployment, DevOps empowers organizations to release high-quality software more Key enabler roles: Play a pivotal role as a key enabler of Integrated IT business management. Collectively they foster a culture of collaboration and integration among essential IT service provider roles. Example roles include product and service owners, business relationship managers, vendor relationship managers, and service delivery managers. When these key roles and others work together with a clear understanding of scope and responsibilities in respect to business relationships this facilitates the alignment of business and IT strategy objectives. Organizational change management: In addition to these methodologies, effective organizational change management is crucial for the successful implementation of any transformation initiative. Change management methodologies provide strategies, tools, and techniques to guide individuals and teams through the process of change, addressing resistance, unnecessary complexity, and elevate customer satisfaction to new heights. customer needs. frequently, reducing time-to-market and enhancing customer experience. building buy-in, and fostering a positive, collaborative, and adaptive culture. Integrated IT business management  better together While each enabler, framework, and practice, such as Lean, Agile, DevOps, key roles, and organizational change management, brings unique value and benefits to IT service organizations, they are most effective when used together as a comprehensive approach. Integrating these models with ITSM process execution allows organizations to leverage the strengths of each methodology while addressing their respective limitations.

Chapter 1: Integrated Enablers, Frameworks, and Practices Benefits of the Integrated Enablers 11 The following is a list of key benefits that derive from using these models together, yielding better results than relying on them individually: Synergy in complementary practices: Each methodology addresses specific aspects of an IT organizational transformation. Lean focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing value, Agile promotes iterative development and collaboration, DevOps emphasizes cross-functional integration and automation, integration of key roles supports improved engagement and organizational change management facilitates smooth transitions. By combining these methodologies, organizations can benefit from their complementary practices, creating a synergy Holistic approach: Based on the principle of systems thinking applied to integrated IT business management. No single model can adequately address the complexity and diversity of these challenges. By using these models together, organizations can take a holistic approach. Adaptability and flexibility: To support business and customer digital strategy IT service organizations need to be adaptive and flexible to respond to rapidly changing customer demands and market dynamics. Each model brings its own set of practices that foster adaptability and Continuous improvement: This is a fundamental principle of many of these models. Lean, Agile, relationship management, and DevOps all prioritize ongoing enhancements and iterative progress. By using these models in conjunction, organizations create a continuous improvement Enhanced value delivery: The ultimate goal of all IT service organizations is to deliver value to customers and stakeholders. Each of these models contributes to value delivery in its own way. While collectively they provide a synergy where the value is greater than the sum of its parts. In summary, using these enablers together provides a comprehensive and balanced approach to integrated IT business management. By leveraging the strengths of each enabler, organizations can address a broader range of challenges, adopt a holistic perspective, foster adaptability, and resilience, manage risk, drive continuous improvement, and ultimately deliver enhanced value to their customers. that covers a wider range of challenges and opportunities. flexibility. mindset that permeates the entire organization.

Chapter 2: Lean IT Lean IT is the extension of Lean manufacturing and Lean services principles to the development and management of information technology, products, and services. Its goal is to continuously improve the value delivered by IT organizations to their customers and the professionalism of people working in IT. Lean IT focuses on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of people working within IT, IT processes, and information technology to enable better value delivery to its customers. The Evolution of Lean IT Lean, as a concept, traces its roots back to the world of manufacturing and people's desire to create and produce products. Many of its most iconic elements have their origin in the Toyota Production System (TPS), first introduced and refined in Japan following the Second World War. Toyota revolutionized production contributing to what became known as the Japanese economic miracle" of the post-war years through a shift in focus away from individual machines and their utilization and towards improving the flow of processes from end to end in ways tied directly to customer demand. The three basic elements of the TPS were just-in-time (JIT) production and a focus on quality and continuous. While Toyota's innovations are at the heart of Lean, other frameworks and models have also influenced it over the years, such as Six Sigma  a derivative of Lean that is a disciplined, data-driven approach for eliminating process and variation, from which Lean borrowed the structured, problem-solving cycle DMAIC. As other companies began to apply elements of the TPS, and as it took on new characteristics and continued to borrow from other methodologies, it evolved into what became known as the Lean production system by the late 80s when the term itself was coined in an article by John Krafcik." improvement. The principles of Lean By the mid-90s, researchers James Womack and Daniel Jones would lay out five key principles of Lean in their book Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation.2 1 Krafcik, John F.

Chapter 2: Lean IT 13 Value is defined by the customer ('voice of the customer) and represents the requirements that a customer has regarding a specific product or service delivered. Value is delivered through a value stream. This is an end to-end process triggered by the customer that ensures the delivery of the required value is received as quickly and as efficiently as possible. It is comprised of all tasks and activities used to bring a product or service from concept For a value stream to deliver value, it must have flow. This means that the activities must follow each other with minimal interruptions and minimal intermediate stockpiles of inventory. This means designing the flow SO each unit that enters the flow is carried out to its Value stream to customer and includes all information, work, and Perfection Customer Flow material flows. value Pull conclusion without interruption. It is also vital to understand that the customer can trigger the value stream when the value is required. This is the essence of pull. A Pull Production System is one that explicitly limits the amount of work in process that can be introduced into the system. Nothing is to be produced Finally, Lean aims for perfection. This does not mean that multiple quality controls need to be in place, causing delays. It means that the organizational culture and everyone engaged in the value stream values continuous improvement and how their work is associated with quality requirements. The essence of perfection is doing things right the first time and ensuring continued Although developed in the world of manufacturing in the intervening years, the principles of Lean have been applied to all industry verticals, including the service industries such as healthcare, finance, until the next process requires it. relevance through continuous improvement. human resources, and banking  and then finally to IT. Enabling Integrated IT Service Management with Lean IT Lean provides a set of practical tools, methods, and practices for examining and improving the delivery of customer value holistically across five dimensions. Customer: Lean encourages analysis and investigation to fully determine if customer value is fully understood and to identify it properly to ensure value is actually being delivered. Process: Lean provides tools and approaches for analyzing and better understanding how customer value is delivered through the concept of flow across a value stream, such as value Organization: Lean offers guidance and tools for aligning resources and steering them towards Performance: Lean offers tools for the establishment of more effective key performance indicators (KPIS) and encourages better forms of measurement to ensure the best use of time and the right stream mapping. customer value, such as visual management techniques like kanban. set of skills and knowledge exist to deliver customer value.

Chapter 2: Lean IT 14 Behavior and attitude: Lean offers guidance and approaches for leadership to ensure the right culture and attitudes exist to best support customer value and continue to improve and pursue Lean's emphasis on these dimensions 1 in particular, on process, organization, and performance  can be utilized to improve any ITSM process and to further encourage and support continuous improvement perfection. over time to ensure continued value delivery. Understanding Lean IT Lean is about aligning and streamlining to deliver customer value. Lean's core focus is value, which means understanding who the customer is, and what they value, and ensuring that all work done is aligned to deliver it to them. Therefore, Lean has a very specific way of looking at work. From a Lean perspective, resource utilization or maximization of work is not a metric Lean focuses on identifying and classitying the value of work using the following categories: of value: Being busy is not equal to adding value. Value-add: Activities that directly add value or progress the unit of work toward completion and help achieve desired outcomes from a customer perspective such as providing customer service, developing new applications, and the operational and or delivery activities involved in keeping customers satisfied. Value-added work Necessary non-value-add: Activities that may add value from the perspective of the business, regulators, or other stakeholders and which are necessary for supporting customer value, but which are not directly experienced or valued by Value-add Optimize Minimize Remove Necessary non-value-add Non-value-add should be optimized. Figure 3: Categories of value the customers themselves, such as governance, planning, or supporting functions human resources or finance and accounting activities. Necessary non-value-added work should be minimized as much as Non-value-add: Activities that add no value or distract from value from any perspective. Non-value Going further, Lean considers non-value-add activities to be a waste or a distraction from customer value-focused activities and provides further guidance for better understanding it by identifying three possible. added work should be removed. key types that may exist: Muda, the term used for traditionally understood useless work or waste and talent, and create fluctuations in cost, quality, and speed Mura, the term used for variability which can cause overcomplexity, lead to mismatches in skill

To better support alignment and enable flow, Lean encourages maximizing transparency and openness in communication to ensure that incidents and problems surface earlier and opportunities for This can be seen in concepts such as jidoka, which emphasizes the joint principles of making defects visible and empowerment of team members to immediately stop work and remove defects early when an abnormal condition has been detected. In support of this principle, Lean encourages leaders to'go to the gemba', or spend meaningful time in the place where work is done observing and engaging with It is also supported through visual management tools. Visual management involves implementing visual controls in plain sight over text-based controls to ensure that information and data are easier to improvement are seized upon. their team. access, remember, and interpret regularly.

Chapter 2: Lean IT 16 There are many examples of visual management utilized in Lean IT. For example: day boards, week boards, and improvement boards. Board'is a relative term because it simply means a place to find a specific form of visualization. These three boards work together as a system of visual aids to support the goals and objectives of the team. Their purpose is to provide regular updates on progress, create visibility around any blockages, and generate and gather improvement problems that allow them to be identified, classified, and addressed for continuous improvement. Objectives for the week Performance: and progress = 25 Dayl board Problems EEE Week board Problems Improvement board ideas. They work together as a register or a list of Figure5:Visual management tools Another commonly adopted visual management tool is called kanban. Kanban emerged directly from the TPS and is a card-based scheduling system for the enablement of new work initiation, embodying Kanban boards come in a variety of forms which may be either analog or digital. They are comprised of cards, where each card represents a unit of work. They visualize a progression of the process as the cards are moved from left to right. This provides the team and the management with a picture of the current state of work and its progression towards being complete, enabling the faster recognition of bottlenecks and the setting of limits on work in progress which promotes improvements in the flow of work and the principle of pull. keeps people from becoming overwhelmed or overburdened.

Chapter 2: Lean IT 17 Lean is about pursuing perfection and encouraging continuous improvement. The principle of pursuing perfection in Lean focuses on continuous improvement, best exemplified by the concept Kaizen is a two-part Japanese word.'Kai', the root, means to change;'zen' for the better. Kaizen specifically targets small-step, incremental change. It encourages a general kaizen mindset at a high level  a cultural norm across the organization in which people understand that it's the job of an individual and the team to identify problems, to pick them up and to own them, to solve those problems and then However, while many IT management models endorse of kaizen. KAIZEN CHANGE FOR THE BETTER to share lessons learned with others. Figure7: The meaning of kaizen continuous improvement, Lean also offers a specific approach and practical techniques that can be applied to continuous improvement projects. One example of this is the kaizen event. Kaizen events consist of five phases starting with a problem statement and progressing toward embedded improvement implementation. As mentioned, this is also known as the DMAIC cycle and has been borrowed from Six Sigma, with the letters standing fori its five phases: define, measure, analyze, improve, and control, as shown below. Define the problem statement: Create an understanding of the problem with everyone involved Define Control mplementation to ensure the sustainability and stability of the improved process: Share the lessons learned Measure the data, gather facts: Validate measurements Control Measure Improve the solution candidates: Develop actions and owners Prioritize and decide Implement actions Figure 8: The DMAIC cycle Analyze the data: Establish the influence factor Identify (root) causes Definel hypotheses Improve Analyze

Chapter 8: Agile Scrum "Agile is an iterative project management style focused on the early delivery of business value, continuous improvement, scope flexibility, team input, and delivering well-tested products that reflect Being agile means shortening the overall development and delivery cycle, decreasing costs associated with development, and increasing quality. Ultimately, Agile development practices deliver on all three customer needs." "3 dimensions of value cost, quality, and speed. The Evolution of Agile In the late 1990s, ITe experienced an application development crisis in which it was struggling to maintain the pace necessary to meet customer objectives in the face of the technological revolution driving increased demand for new software and new IT capabilities within organizations. By 2001, many emerging approaches to rapid application development had proven successful, such as extreme programming (XP), borrowing from a range of methodologies and frameworks that had worked elsewhere including Lean. In February of that year, seventeen of the most well-known developers who had experienced these challenges and had some success addressing them met to discuss their various solutions and find common ground. What emerged was the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, The Agile Manifesto states that its goal is "uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it." The Agile Manifesto includes the four values indicated to the right.4 Agile development emphasizes rapid iteration with continuous customer inputs. Agile development, or Scrum, is often recognized as a hands-on style used by start-upss. This is because Agile principles emphasize building working software that people can actively use instead of spending a lot of time writing specifications beforehand. In addition, Agile development focuses on cross-functional teams that are empowered to make decisions instead of big hierarchies and compartmentalization by function. commonly referred to as the Agile Manifesto. 3 Layton, Mark C. and Steven J.

Chapter 3: Agile Scrum 20 Enabling Integrated IT Service Management with Agile While most associated with the context of software development, Agile practices and particularly Scrum  have since been increasingly utilized in other IT management process areas to create flow and increase the speed of delivery. This is because many areas of ITSM can benefit from its more iterative, Many organizations rely heavily on predictive development models (sometimes known as waterfall" development) which take an entire deliverable through large phases of requirements, design, development, integration, testing, and deployment. Progress flows steadily through linear phases. While this approach may work in a situation where a target state or deliverable is well known it does not work well for work focused on innovation. or customization. The issue with using a predictive approach for this type of work is that customers do not always know their exact requirements going into development, leading to changing requirements, redesign, redevelopment, retesting, and increased costs. IT development projects are also increasingly complex and time-intensive, and therefore traditional approaches create a situation in which the time to market is too long to ensure business value. Adaptive development models, in contrast, are iterative and incremental in their approach to planning, developing, and delivering. These models use collaboration as a foundation of their success. These models are seen as circular and repetitive because they break a large deliverable into smaller, more manageable deliverables, and they also circulate the development through the repeated activity of requirements, design, development, integration, and testing. Deployment is a separate phase that follows In the case of Agile and Scrum, the breakdown and visibility of work are present but without the heavy overhead amounts of detail that traditional project management requires. Scrum seeks to optimize the time spent on work and planning  just in time and just enough versus traditional project management, which spends a significant amount of up-front time planning in advance in an exhaustive and detailed The major value difference between the two approaches is that traditional predictive project management is based on project work that focuses on the replication of well-known solutions where the end can be predicted before work begins. This allows a calculated, controlled, managed, and focused approach that schedules resources and budgets. Traditional development models are still best suited to predictive projects and products where the requirements and scope are fixed, the product itself is firm and stable, and the technology is clearly understood. Traditional development models are also well suited to In contrast, adaptive development models should be considered for situations that involve innovation, creativity, and an unknown end state. Adaptive or Agile methods are the only logical approach to projects and products where requirements and scope will evolve, and/or the product itself will evolve. flexible approach to development and project management. iterative development. way. situations where contracts are involved and are of a fixed price and scope.

Chapter 3: Agile Scrum 21 Understanding Agile Scrum adaptive solutions for complex problems. "7 Scrum is "a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through Scrum provides a structure of roles, artifacts, events, and rules for developing products. Scrum is not a defined process, but an empirical knowledge approach driven by observations. Work is done in increments by one or more self-managing, cross-functional, and high-performing teams responsible for Scrum is not limited to a specific process or set of techniques. It is a tramework within which organizations can employ processes and techniques. Like all frameworks, Scrum is best adopted when Various processes, techniques, and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques SO thati improvements can be made. At the heart of Agile Scrum is the principle of agility  the ability to be dexterous, which could mean the To support that kind of agility, three critical success factors must be performed that are called the three creating and adapting processes within the framework. tailored to an organization's environment. ability to pivot and to be flexible at speed. pillars of Agile: Transparency: The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk. Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is Inspection: The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events. Inspection enables adaptation. pointless.

Chapter 3: Agile Scrum 22 Adaptation: If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation. Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection. The Scrum process is illustrated in the graphic below. The Scrum process Product backlog refinement Sprint planning Product backlog Daily stand-up Sprint Demo review Sprint retrospective DONE Sprint 1-4 weeks Iteration Sprint backlog Usable increment Figure 11: The Scrum process On the left-hand side, there is a product backlog that contains all the various forms of demand. The backlog needs to be constantly refined, reordered, and reprioritized by the product owner. Every At the beginning of a sprint  a period between one to four weeks maximum 1 thereis a planning meeting. This is a meeting where the Scrum team pulls from the top of the backlog the amount of work that is Then, work is further broken down into tasks, and those tasks are assigned to individual roles. Since now everyone knows the roles and dependencies, and throughout this one-to-four-week process, there is a daily 15-minute stand-up meeting where the Scrum team gets together and talks about the three statements: Each individual's: report on what was done yesterday, what is planned for today, and if there are any roadblocks. Hence, the team reviews the challenges and ways to overcome them daily. day, as new work arrives, it must be re-sequenced in priority. believed doable within the sprint.

Chapter 3: Agile Scrum 23 At the end of the sprint, there are two events, or ceremonies: 1. The sprint review, or demo, with the customer when the output of the sprint is demonstrated to the customer and feedback is sought around the current outcome. It is through transparency, inspection, and adaptation that new ideas, new thoughts, and feedback will then drive changes, 2. Before a new sprint has started, the team must follow the discipline ofl having a sprint retrospective meeting where they look at the continuous improvement and lessons learned for the next sprint period. Using transparency, inspection, and adaptation principles, what went well, what didn't, and what needs to be done differently in the next sprint are analyzed. possibly in scope. Scrum at-a-glance The Scrum framework, as described in the Scrum Guides, consists of the Scrum team and their associated accountabilities, the Sprint which is a container for all other events, and three key artifacts. Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum.

Chapter 3: Agile Scrum 24 The Scrum process has a set of roles, events, and artifacts. Roles include: A] product owner who owns the accountability for the product lifecycle, and the product backlog A Scrum Master whose role will be described later as the coach or process owner for the Scrum The developers, or the individual subject matter experts, who are assembled as a cross-functional team to accomplish the goal, contributing their specializations to the sprint completion. Among events, there is the sprint and its additional events: sprint planning, daily Scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. There is also sprint execution which, while mentioned, is not an official Scrum The goal of the events, sometimes called ceremonies, is to minimize the amount of time spent on those activities that are necessary but not directly contributing to forward progression, mostly necessary non value. This: is to follow the Lean principle to optimize the individual team's time on value-adding, value Finally, there are specific artifacts like the product backlog that is constantly groomed, the sprint backlog, which is the backlog of work for this specific period, and usable increments, which are defined in part event. progressing work. by what's called a definition of done.

Chapter 4: Organizational Change Management Organizational change is simply stated as moving from the old way of doing things (the old way of working, the old identity, the old management structure, etc.) to a new way. But not to be fooled by the simple statement (old to new,) organizational change is hard, not easy. The goal of moving from the old way to a new way is to achieve positive outcomes for the organization; for example, products and services are delivered faster, customer and user engagement is enhanced, internal work processes are more effective and efficient, and both customers and employees are happier. However, a positive outcome is not always achieved. The Evolution of Organizational Change Management (OCM) William Bridges in his best-selling book, Managing Transitions: Making the Most ofChange, emphasizes the difference between what is changing and the normal human response to the personal changes that he calls transitions, which people need to make in response to the change. Bridges defines them as: Change is situational; for example, the move to adopt integrated IT service management capabilities and process improvements requires changes to reporting structure, roles and skills, processes, new Transition is psychological; it is a three-phase process that people go through as they internalize and technology, and possibly suppliers. come to terms with the details of the new situation that the change brings about.9 These phases are: 3. Ending: Involves letting go of the old ways and familiarities. It's about acknowledging and accepting that the current situation or state is coming to an end. During this phase, individuals may experience a range of emotions such as resistance, denial, sadness, and anxiety. They may 4. Neutral zone:. Also known as the in-between'phase. This phase is characterized by ambiguity, disorientation, and a lack of clarity. The old ways have ended, but the new ways or structures grieve the loss of the old ways and feel uncertain about what lies ahead. have not yet fully taken shape. 9] Bridges, Susan, and William Bridges. Managing Transitions, 25th Aniversary Edition: Making the Most of Change. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Lifelong Books, 2017.

Chapter 4: Organizational Change Management 26 Individuals may feel unsettled and may experience a sense of loss or confusion during this phase. However, the neutral zone is also a period of opportunity for exploration, creativity, and experimentation. It is a time to reflect, learn, and adapt to the changes taking place. 5. New beginning: This is where individuals start to embrace and integrate the changes into their lives. In this phase, individuals begin to gain clarity about the new direction, purpose, and ways of doing things. They start to develop new routines, roles, and relationships. The focus shifts from the past to the future, and individuals experience a renewed sense of energy, motivation, It's important to note that these phases are not linear and can overlap or fluctuate in duration and intensity. People may progress through the phases at different speeds, and their experiences may vary. Recognizing and understanding these phases can help individuals and organizations navigate transitions more effectively, support individuals through the emotional and psychological aspects of and commitment. change, and facilitate a smoother transition process. The technical side and people side of projects Change is (always) about moving from a current state (the way things are done now) to a future state (the new way). In between the two is a transition state that might be long or short depending on the change. In many cases, the structure for these changes is provided through a defined project to design, In most cases, this change or these changes impact people. Employees will need to do their jobs differently to get to the future state. Depending on the nature of the change(s) or the scope of the change, this may affect a few people to hundreds, ifi not thousands, of people. The impact on people can be small, large, or somewhere in between. Organizational change management complements project management by focusing on the people side of change. Organizational change management activities help support people through the transition(s) needed to embrace, adopt, and use what has been changed.10 develop, and deliver what is being changed. What is organizational change management? There is no universal best-practice definition for organizational change management. As a discipline, organizational change management draws from psychology, sociology, organizational development, leadership practices, management practices, learning and development, and other domains. Regardless Organizational change management is defined as a business discipline focused on the people side of An organizational change management discipline and practice are needed whenever an organization undertakes a program or project that changes the way people work, their roles and responsibilities, and their working relationships with their teams or their management  as well as how the organization's of the many definitions that exist, all include a focus on the people side of change. change. strategy, business model, operating model, or culture are impacted. 10 Creasey, Tim.

Chapter 4: Organizational Change Management 27 Enabling Integrated IT Service Management with OCM Most IT service management projects require people to work or behave differently. These may be small, medium, or large changes and some may include changes for the business users of the IT products and When we introduce IT service management processes or make improvements to our existing processes, we may need to create new reporting structures, jobs and job titles, new roles, new skill profiles, and new team and individual performance measures. Tools may change, including asking groups to abandon the tools they have used and start using the new tools, process activities may change which, for example, All of these are changes to our current way of doing things. Organizational change management enables an integrated approach to IT service management processes by providing the discipline to help people Organizational change management helps organizations realize success with any size change. Without this discipline, many integrated IT service management fail to realize the expectations and outcomes of John Kotter and several other researchers and authors have cited failure rates for projects of all types. Integrated IT service management projects are not immune to the statistics described by these authors. In 1996, John Kotter said, "More than 70 percent of needed change either fails to be launched.. [or] to be completed"; and "the same appalling 70 percent figure" for change failure. It's suggested this was a'finger in the air estimate'that gained remarkable traction. However, further research has added more In 2014, the Business Technology Association (BTA) studied 13 major change projects and found the same disappointing 30% success rate.

Based on governance and strategy planning the organization's business objectives must first be clarified. Current priorities, the financial climate feasibility, strategic initiatives, etc. should all be taken into consideration before launching a new change initiative. initiative. 11 Cruise, David.

Stage 1 is where the need for change is identified, the vision and strategy for what is changing are agreed upon, the business case for the project is approved, and the project team is chartered. From there, stages 2, 3, and 4 address the people side of change (organizational change management) while continuing to align with the technical side of change (project management). objectives. embedded within the culture and practices of the organization.

Chapter 5: DevOps DevOps is a movement represented by the convergence of existing IT best practices from ITSM plus Lean, and Agile into a development and operations approach that supports automation. and continuous delivery. It also encourages a culture of collaboration and learning to help IT deliver business value better, faster, and cheaper than ever before. The Evolution of DevOps DevOps, a term representing a blending of the words development and'operations', first arose in response to conversations in the IT community related to addressing conflicts between developers and system administrators in the mid-2000s. These conflicts had emerged due to gaps in values, culture, and practice between traditional waterfall development approaches and newer agile approaches such as scrum used by developers which were not always inclusive of the needs or capacity of those in operations. As open-source toolsets also began to be used more widely and attract attention, it created a perfect storm in which various converging adjacent methodologies for addressing this conflict and While DevOps is primarily known as an enabler of greater automation, the main principles of the DevOps movement extend beyond that. DevOps builds upon Lean and agile principles to advocate for the breaking down of silos between traditional development and operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to create a culture of cross-functional teaming and increased collaboration while implementing the kind of standardization and optimization that are ultimately required to properly support meaningful automation that drives value at the necessary speed of today's ongoing digital transformation. To dot this, resulting challenges of speed, flow, and automation became known as DevOps. it must look at the full stack of culture, practices, and automation together.

Culture 7 #7T T Figure 14: The Full Stack of DevOps Enabling Integrated IT Service Management with DevOps When implemented across the full stack, DevOps is focused on many of the same areas as Lean and Agile standardization, optimization, and creating a culture of better collaboration towards the goal of increasing speed and flexibility without compromising customer value. What DevOps adds is a specific emphasis on improving the communication between development and operations to ensure continual delivery and minimize the accumulation. of technical debt, particularly through or in support of layers of This has particular implications for execution processes focused on transition planning such as change management, release and deployment management, and service assurance and testing, which are Continuous delivery is an evolution of what has been known as the software development lifecycle and/or software development management. It assumes that there are a series of activities that can be streamlined and modified to create flow through code and automation where appropriate, as below. automation. addressed through DevOps'approach to continuous delivery.

Chapter 5: DevOps 32 Continuous Integration Automated building Automated testing Automated provisioning Automated deployment 888880088888 Figure 15: The stages of DevOps automation This is conceptualized as a toolchain or pipeline that reflects an overall automated process that integrates multiple existing processes and capabilities rather than a series of automated individual steps. In continuous delivery, each tool integrates with and flows into another. For example, if the code is committed to the source repository called the trunk, an automated set of management practices executes and gets it right to the point of shipping, possibly over the line into production, going from continuous delivery to continuous deployment.

Chapter 5: DevOps 33 Understanding DevOps The challenge of achieving continuous delivery and deployment involves breaking down barriers and walls between the development and operation teams in the organization. Therefore, DevOps involves stages of evolution in organizational teaming and collaboration. Stage 1: Dev and Ops (increased collaboration) Stage 2: DevOps (dedicated team) Stage 3: DevOps (cross-functional teams) Figure 17: The evolution of the DevOps team structure The first stage of the evolution of the DevOps team structure is simply putting into place elements and solutions that allow for increased collaboration between Dev and Ops. Examples include the co-location of Dev and Ops teams in common workspaces or digitally enabling communication through shared collaboration and communication solutions. The; goal is to take the Dev and Ops functions that once were siloed and encourage them to work in cross-functional teams that are close-knit and highly collaborative Some organizations take a you build it, you run it'approach, making developers more responsible for operating their applications in production to help both teams fully understand the needs of each other, The second stage of DevOps team structures is the dedicated DevOps team, implemented in a way that discourages its existence as another silo. Frequently the team composition at this stage will include members from development, testing, and security but not include operations roles. The narrow team composition to upstream design, build, and test capabilities does not represent the DevOps intent of creating a full-stack team that includes roles from an operation's perspective. Often, this means implementing a DevOps team'with the idea of continuing to evolve it with the third stage in mind. The third stage of the evolution of team structure in DevOps is the re-organization of Dev and Ops into Cross-functional teams are built with representatives of all disciplines who have the responsibility for developing and deploying a service. They are designed to be empowered, self-managed, and self sufficient. These teams may be temporary, assembled only to work on short-term projects but they may also be permanent. Most importantly, these teams resemble the adaptive, self-organizing teams that will be needed to achieve an ideal end goal of true integration of the product and platform teams through and that work side by side towards the same goals. and further break down the silo mentality. cross-functional teams that include stakeholders from both Dev and Ops functions. automation, as illustrated below.

The adoption of standardized environments supports the goal of self-service for product teams. As previously described, cross-functional product teams have members from each specialization. However, most organizations will struggle with how to practically scale this approach with limited resources. The answer to this challenge is to adopt highly automated build, test, provisioning, and deployment solutions. However, this final goal presupposes a couple of critical success factors and environmental conditions which include: The majority of the technology environment is software-defined and supports continuous delivery automation, cloud-based elasticity, self-healing, and remediation. (Infrastructure, software-defined network, database configuration, environmental configuration). Change risks can be lowered by leveraging abstraction techniques such as containerization, and Testing coverage and confidence cover the majority of the environment to support continuous deployment based on automated go/no-go'decisions based on trusted test results. Shared platform tooling is leveraged by the product teams which is enabled by standard artifacts, serverless computing. scripts, and orchestration automation. The DevOps'Full Stack The concept of the DevOps''Full Stack'approach as described above is a play-on-words leveraging a popular technology and architecture concept that simply means the full story. While each of the layers of this stack is critical, there is an order of sequence and dependency that must be addressed for success.

Chapter 5: DevOps 35 Unless an organization understands that at its heart the DevOps movement represents a combination. of organizational, cultural, process, and technological change efforts that must work together, DevOps will not be successful. The very name of this movement, DevOps, is the blending or merging of two separate traditional IT functions into one team sharing common values, practices, and priorities. System-wide For DevOps to be successful various stakeholder groups need to share common beliefs, practices, and priorities and understand the importance and related dependencies between each of the layers. velocity is impossible if each IT group is trying to be Agile in different directions.

Chapter 6: Key Enabler Roles Establishing key enabler roles is a strategic approach to establishing ownership and accountability for IT management capabilities and resources focused on building and nurturing positive relationships with stakeholders. It focuses on understanding their needs, building trust, delivering value, maintaining open communication, and continuously improving to achieve mutual benefits and long-term success. These key enabler roles facilitate effective relationship management, communication channels, and mechanisms enabling the flow of information between business stakeholders and IT service providers. This exchange of insights and feedback helps shape IT strategies, prioritize initiatives, and align Ultimately, the adoption of key roles to support relationship management activities enables organizations to deliver value tol both thel business organization and its customers. By fostering alignment between business and IT, these defined roles empower organizations to achieve their business goals resources accordingly. while ensuring customer satisfaction through the delivery of high-quality IT services. Enabling Integrated IT Service Management with Key Roles A fundamental principle in any management system is the necessity of establishing ownership and accountability. This is crucial for the continual improvement of resources, products, or services. Active governance and leadership are essential, with a dedicated role responsible for setting future targets. This role involves managing resources to bridge the gap between their current and desired future states. Without this focused approach, resources risk suffering from inadequate governance and management. In IT service management (ITSM), assigning key roles for ownership and management is vital. These roles contribute to continuous improvement, with a strong focus on customer needs. Responsibilities include understanding customer requirements, engaging with stakeholders effectively, managing service levels, ensuring customer satisfaction, and driving service improvements. Moreover, these roles are instrumental in resolving conflicts, aligning IT services with business objectives, and fostering long lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with customers and stakeholders.

Chapter 6: Key Enabler Roles 37 Examples of Key Enabler Roles The focus of establishing these key enabler roles is to cultivate intentional governance and management while establishing a culture of collaboration and integration among critical IT service provider roles. These roles focus on bridging the relational gap between business and IT functions in support of the overall principles of integrated IT business management. The roles include business relationship managers, product and service owners, vendor relationship managers, and service delivery managers, among others. These roles work together to develop a comprehensive understanding of the business needs and requirements and ensure high-quality products and services align seamlessly with the overarching business strategy. Business relationship manager The role of the business relationship manager (BRM) is to establish, manage, and enhance positive relationships with customers through intentional and proactive engagement. The business relationship manager assumes various responsibilities: Serving as the liaison between the customers and the IT service provider, understanding and conveying customer needs to the service provider, and communicating the service provider's Managing the relationship with the customer based on two guiding principles: ensuring no IT service surprises for customers and no customer surprises for the service provider. Supporting the business customer by creating business case documentation, participating in strategic meetings to understand future direction and objectives, defining customer service requirements and success criteria, managing conflicts and complaints, and providing updates on Assisting with organizational change management activities, such as advising on change management, creating communication plans, monitoring communication effectiveness, coordinating with other departments, and ensuring customer readiness for releases.
